## About

wagger is a command line tool for tailing files. It is a
cross-platform tool that is meant to replace BareTail on Windows, and is a
drop-in replacement for Tail on Linux and Mac. Unlike the Unix tail it has
highlighting and filtering capabilities.

### Built With

- [Go](https://golang.org/)

## Getting Started

To get started, will need to create an executable for your platform.

```bash
make build
```

Or, if you need to build an executable for a specific platform, you can use one
of the following commands:

```bash
make build-windows
make build-linux
make build-darwin
```

You can also create builds for profiling with the following commands:

```bash
make build-profile-mem
make build-prfile-cpu
make build-repe
```

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/)
- [Make](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/make.1.html)

### Installation

wagger is an executable that is intended to be used with a config file. A basic
config file can be found [here](wagger.yml). This config file **must**
be located in the same directory as the executable.

## Usage

To use wagger, run the executable with the following command:

```bash
wagger
```

This command will read the file and apply highlighting.

If you only want to see highlighted lines, you can use the `--only-highlight` `-o` flag:

```bash
wagger --only-highlight
```

If you want to ignore lines that match, you can use the `--ignore` `-i` flag:

```bash
wagger --ignore 
```

To tail the log file, use the `tail` command:

```bash
wagger tail
```

The same filtering flags apply.
